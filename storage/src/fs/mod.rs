/// Storage backend filesystem interface.
///
/// Trait `NvFs` defines an interface to a storage backend filesystem
/// implementation for the other components to store sensitive data on.
///
/// # Filesystem model
///
/// In contrast to common general-purpose filesystems, it is not assumed that
/// arbitrary filenames or any sort of hierarchic directory structure is
/// supported: inodes are identified and referred to directly by `u64` integers.
///
/// Moreover, it is expected that individual files are generally small and that
/// it's affordable to always read or write them as a whole -- partial reads or
/// updates (and seeks accordingly) are not supported. This limitation enables
/// implementations to use fresh random encryption block cipher mode IVs for
/// each file update, thereby achieving stronger security properties than what's
/// provided by common block layer based encryption scheme like e.g. XTS or
/// CBC-ESSIV.
///
/// In addition to the data, an `u8` flags value available for free use by
/// applications is associated with each allocated inode.
///
/// # Execution model
///
/// In order to enable integration with a wide range of different execution
/// environments with different characteristics, the `NvFs` API is defined in
/// terms of Rust's `async` [`Future`] concept. Note that this does not mandate
/// a target execution environment to implement any actual asynchronous
/// processing semantics -- all `NvFs` [`Future`]s could just as well get polled
/// synchronously to completion by some minimal `async` executor like e.g.
/// [`Pollster`](https://docs.rs/pollster/latest/pollster/) or similar if desired.
///
/// `NvFs` [`Future`]s are never anonymous -- i.e. what one would get out of
/// Rust's `async` keyword -- so that they can get stored in a [`Box`] on the
/// heap or in some other dependendant [`Future`]. The possibility of moving
/// execution state away from the stack and storing it on the heap might be
/// advantageous for stack constrained environments like kernels.
///
/// The `NvFs` methods don't in fact return [`Future`]s, but [`NvFsFuture`]s.
/// The latter differ from the former only in that they take an additional
/// `fs_instance` argument, thereby potentially avoiding the need of creating
/// and storing additional [`SyncRcPtr`](sync_types::SyncRcPtr) clones for the
/// fs instance or for passing [random number
/// generator](rng::RngCoreDispatchable) ownership in and out). In cases where a
/// proper Rust [`Future`] is needed, [`NvFsFuture`] implementation instances
/// can get wrapped in a [`NvFsFutureAsCoreFuture`].
///
/// # Transactions and Consistent Read Sequences
///
/// Any updates, both to metadata and to file data, are to be accumulated at a
/// [`Transaction`](Self::Transaction), started via
/// [`start_transaction()`](Self::start_transaction), which may eventually get
/// [committed](Self::commit_transaction) for the changes to take effect on the
/// backing storage atomically. Conceptually, the preparation of a
/// [`Transaction`](Self::Transaction) in its
/// pre-[commit](Self::commit_transaction) phase is considered a sequence of
/// mere read-only operations.
///
/// Due to the nature of the asynchronous execution model, it's always possible
/// that a sequence of read operations from one thread runs concurrently to a
/// [`Transaction`](Self::Transaction) [commit](Self::commit_transaction) from
/// another one, which might render some of the prior reads obsolete. As
/// (external) locking schemes are inherently susceptible to lock holding
/// threads "loosing interest" and not making any further progress, which might
/// or might not be an actual issue for a given target execution environment, a
/// retry mechanism in the form of "consistent read sequences" is implemented
/// instead.
///
/// Users of the `NvFs` API seeking to maintain consistency across multiple read
/// operations would initiate a
/// [`ConsistentReadSequence`](Self::ConsistentReadSequence)
/// via [`start_read_sequence()`](Self::start_read_sequence) and pass the
/// obtained handle to any subsequent read primitive to be included in the
/// consistency chain. If some [`Transaction`](Self::Transaction) gets
/// [committed](Self::commit_transaction) concurrently after the
/// [`ConsistentReadSequence`](Self::ConsistentReadSequence) had been started,
/// the read sequence will become "stale". Once that happens, any pending
/// or future `NvFs` read primitive operating on the now broken
/// [`ConsistentReadSequence`](Self::ConsistentReadSequence) will return an
/// error of [`NvFsError::Retry`].
///
/// A [`Transaction`](Self::Transaction) in its
/// pre-[commit](Self::commit_transaction) preparation phase is implicitly
/// considered a "consistent read sequence" itself: it either begins at the
/// corresponding [`start_transaction()`](Self::start_transaction) or may even
/// extend further back by continuing on a previously created
/// [`ConsistentReadSequence`](Self::ConsistentReadSequence) specified to the
/// [`start_transaction()`](Self::start_transaction). In particular, a
/// [`Transaction`](Self::Transaction) [commit](Self::commit_transaction) would
/// always invalidate all other pending [`Transaction`](Self::Transaction)s
/// currently still in their pre-commit preparation phase. For clarity: this
/// means that only one out of a set of concurrently prepared
/// [`Transaction`](Self::Transaction)s
/// can get [committed](Self::commit_transaction) successfully, all other would
/// fail with [`NvFsError::Retry`] at some point.
///
/// For any `NvFs` read primitive, it is possible to read either the state as
/// last committed to storage, or, alternatively, through a
/// [`Transaction`](Self::Transaction) still under preparation for reading the
/// state as if that transaction had been committed at the current point. Users
/// specify the desired context to the respective read primitive by passing a
/// [`NvFsReadContext`]. For the [`Transaction`](Self::Transaction) case,
/// the read primitives assume exclusive ownership of the
/// [`Transaction`](Self::Transaction), as wrapped in a [`NvFsReadContext`].
/// On completion, the [`NvFsReadContext`] instance will get returned back,
/// from which the [`Transaction`](Self::Transaction) may then get recovered.
///
/// ## Robustness against abandoned [committing](Self::commit_transaction) tasks
///
/// For some `async` execution environments it might, depending on their task
/// model, be possible that a task gets abandoned at some point and never polled
/// again. This is potentially problematic for tasks that issued a
/// [`Transaction`](Self::Transaction) [commit](Self::commit_transaction),
/// but cease to drive progress on the associated
/// [`CommitTransactionFut`](Self::CommitTransactionFut) through
/// [polling](NvFsFuture::poll) at some point: as that could prohibit the
/// initiation of any further
/// [`ConsistentReadSequence`](Self::ConsistentReadSequence) or
/// [`Transaction`](Self::Transaction), it would effectively render the `NvFs`
/// instance  unusable for forever.
///
/// Any `NvFs` implementation possibly deployed in such an `async` execution
/// environment must have provisisons in place so that this scenario cannot
/// happen. A possible solution is to let
/// [`StartReadSequenceFut`](Self::StartReadSequenceFut) and
/// [`StartTransactionFut`](Self::StartTransactionFut) "help out" behind the
/// scenes and collectively take over the polling of a currently pending
/// [`CommitTransactionFut`](Self::CommitTransactionFut), if any.
///
/// ## Write failure tolerance
///
/// Writes to the underlying storage can fail at any time. For example, if the
/// physical storage is attached over a network, it might become temporarily
/// unreachable. Note that this would become particularly relevant if the
/// underlying `NvFs` implementation happened to rely on some external trusted
/// party for rollback protection measures.
///
/// In general there are only two feasible options for a `NvFs` implementation
/// to handle write failures: report an error back to the application or retry
/// the write operation in the hope it will eventually succeed. Which action to
/// take will depend on [`Transaction`](Self::Transaction)
/// [commit](Self::commit_transaction) stage a write failure is being
/// encountered in.
///
/// It is anticipated that a `NvFs` implementation's
/// [`Transaction`](Self::Transaction) [commit](Self::commit_transaction)
/// resembles the following process:
/// 1. Journal setup
///     1. Some kind of journal is written to storage by the `NvFs`
///        implementation. This would involve writing copies of the updated data
///        to some otherwise unused storage locations and setting up some
///        metadata describing the updates.
///     2. Some flag indicating the journal is complete and to be considered
///        effective is written.
/// 2. The journal is then subsequently getting applied, i.e. all data updates
///    applied to their target location on storage.
/// 3. The journal is possibly getting cleaned up again.
///
/// ### Write failures during journal setup
///
/// Failures encountered during 1.1 are non-critical: as long as the "journal is
/// ready" flag from step 1.2 has not been written yet, any updates staged to
/// the journal wouldn't take effect after a possible power cut. Thus, for any
/// error encountered during that phase, the transaction commit can simply get
/// cancelled and the error reported back for the
/// [committer](Self::commit_transaction) to take action as appropriate, e.g. to
/// fail the associated user request and dismiss any pending updates to the
/// application state.
///
/// Failures encountered during the "journal is ready" flag write in step 1.2 on
/// the other hand are very much critical as far as consistency is concerned. If
/// that happens, the storage state is indeterminate: depending on whether the
/// flag update made it to physical storage or not, the journal could either be
/// found as being complete and thus, applicable, after a power cut or it could
/// be found in a partially written state. In the former case, the associated
/// data updates would be considered effective while in the latter case the
/// journal would get cancelled and any staged data updates dismissed.
///
/// *In either case, it is important that the application's state or the user's
/// view does not become inconsistent with what's effective on storage --
/// especially as adversaries might be able to actively provoke storage service
/// interruptions or power cuts in certain execution environments.*
///
/// There are basically two options for `NvFs` implementations to handle a write
/// failure encountered during 1.2:
/// 1. Retry until success and complete the corresponding
///    [`CommitTransactionFut`](Self::CommitTransactionFut) only afterwards.
/// 2. Attempt to cancel the journal on storage and report the
///    [`CommitTransactionFut`](Self::CommitTransactionFut) as failed to the
///    issuing application.
///
/// As it is completely unpredictable how much time it will take for the
/// underlying hardware to recover, if ever at all, it is generally favorable to
/// go with the second option, because that allows for a timely completion of
/// the [`CommitTransactionFut`](Self::CommitTransactionFut) with an error and
/// enables the issuing application to move on.
///
/// More specifically, upon encountering  a write error during step 1.2, a
/// `NvFs` implementation may choose to
/// * complete the associated
///   [`CommitTransactionFut`](Self::CommitTransactionFut) with an error,
///   informing the issuing application about the
///   [`TransactionCommitError::LogStateIndeterminate`] condition and
/// * let subsequently initiated
///   [`StartReadSequenceFut`](Self::StartReadSequenceFut)s or
///   [`StartTransactionFut`](Self::StartTransactionFut)s, if any, attempt to
///   bring the storage into a determinate state again by cancelling the journal
///   on it before proceeding any further. Note that these cannot complete
///   anyway before the storage has been brought back into a determinate state,
///   so they serve as natural entry points for journal cancellation retries --
///   chances are that enough time has passed in the meanwhile for the
///   underlying hardware to recover.
///
/// With that, the application
/// * can safely dismiss any pending updates to its internal state right away,
/// * map the [`TransactionCommitError::LogStateIndeterminate`] to some
///   application specific error code to present to the user, perhaps indicating
///   that the staged updates might possibly still become effective after a
///   potential power cut happening with no further (successful) reads or writes
///   before it,
/// * continue to use the `NvFs` functionality as usual, with any
///   [`StartReadSequenceFut`](Self::StartReadSequenceFut)s or
///   [`StartTransactionFut`](Self::StartTransactionFut)s simply failing as long
///   as the journal cancellation has not succeeded yet.
///
/// In particular, applications having a need for explictly determining the
/// underlying storage state may start "probing" [`read
/// sequences`](Self::start_read_sequence), which will succeed only once the
/// journal has been cancelled. As an alternative,
/// the convenience [`NvFs::try_cleanup_indeterminate_commit_log()`] is
/// provided.
///
/// ### Write failures during journal application
///
/// When in stage 2. or later, the updates are considered effective. A `NvFs`
/// implementation **must not** report any write failures encountered at this
/// stage back *while leaving the journal in place*, because the data updates
/// would still take effect after a power cut, thereby causing an inconsistent
/// view for the user who would have previously observed an error. As chances
/// are that a cancellation of the journal wouldn't succeed either at this
/// point, the best option a `NvFs` implementation has is to retry the journal
/// application until it succeeds. A `NvFs` implementation may choose to either
/// * keep the corresponding
///   [`CommitTransactionFut`](Self::CommitTransactionFut) pending and complete
///   it only once the journal application has eventually succeeded,
/// * or to complete it immediately with success and let subsequently initiated
///   [`StartReadSequenceFut`](Self::StartReadSequenceFut)s or
///   [`StartTransactionFut`](Self::StartTransactionFut)s, if any, take over and
///   continue with further attempts to apply the journal.
///
/// The second option is almost always preferable, because
/// * from the application's point of view the storage update has succeeded --
