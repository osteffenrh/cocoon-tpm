//! Lock and `Arc` abstraction traits as well as related functionality.
//!
//! # Execution environment agnostic sync type abstractions
//!
//! In `[no_std]` environments, the `std::sync::Mutex` or `std::sync::RwLock`
//! are unavailable and the exact semantics of a provided lock implementation
//! depend heavily on the target execution environment -- it could be anything
//! ranging from a simple spinlock up to a full blown mutex with scheduling
//! semantics. In order to facilitate integrations into any possible
//! environment, define abstraction traits for locks and `Arc`s that the rest of
//! the code can be made generic over: [`ConstructibleLock`], [`RwLock`] and
//! [`SyncRcPtr`]/[`SyncRcPtrFactory`]. For limiting the amount of generic
//! parameters to get specified all over the place, group them together as
//! associated types of the [`SyncTypes`] trait expected to get implemented for
//! a target execution environment. Execution environments might want to
//! consider using the provided [`GenericArcFactory`] for their
//! [`SyncRcPtrFactory`].
//!
//! # Elimination of [`Lock`] or [`SyncRcPtr`] nesting in data structures
//!
//! It is a common scenario for [`Lock`]s and [`SyncRcPtr`]s to nest in the
//! following way: a structure protected by a [`Lock`] could contain a member
//! for which some API operating on that expects the member itself to be wrapped
//! in [`Lock`] and similar for [`SyncRcPtr`]s. In such scenarios the inner
//! member would have to get wrapped in a [`Lock`] or [`SyncRcPtr`] exclusively
//! for the reason of complying with the API's expectations -- after all, a lock
//! on the containing `struct` grants exclusive access to the inner member as
//! well and analogous for [`SyncRcPtr`]s. As atomic operations typically have
//! some performance cost, it's desirable to eliminate the need for wrapping the
//! member in an extra [`Lock`] or [`SyncRcPtr`]. For such scenarios the
//! [`LockForInner`] and [`SyncRcPtrForInner`] implementations are provided.
